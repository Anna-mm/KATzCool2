My custom color scheme for PHPStorm IDE by JetBrains. It's something I've honed over the year little by little. No
doubt in my mind that it's influenced by dozens of dark-colored themes, but I don't have any particlar references.

* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* SQL
* PHP

Other languages are skipped simply becuase I don't reach for them often enough.
