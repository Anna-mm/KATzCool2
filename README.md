# PHPStorm and KATzCool2

This is my hand-tuned color theme for use in the amazing dev tool PHPStorm by JetBrains.
It's something I've honed over the year little by little. No doubt in my mind that it's
influenced by dozens of dark-colored themes, but I don't have any particular references
to call out.

Give it a try and see how to you like it. If it's useful for you please pass on a kind
word about it to your friends and collegues!

Languages the color theme supports are admittedly Ken-centric including these:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* SQL
* PHP

Other languages are skipped simply because I don't reach for them often enough.

## Install Location for OSX

Preferences -> IDE Settings -> Editor -> Colors & Fonts -> Scheme Name

## Favorite Fonts
This programmer font is highly recommended as I've used it daily for years and I know
I'm more productive because it exists:

[Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font)

Out of nowhere I've suddenly switched to this font as Adobe dropped it on the world just
a few weeks ago and I think it's fantastic:

[Adobe Source Code Pro Mono](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html)
