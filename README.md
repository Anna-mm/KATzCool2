# KATCool2 Color Theme

This is my hand-tuned color theme for use in the amazing dev tools RubyMine and PHPStorm
by JetBrains.
It's something I've honed over the year little by little to suit my taste. No doubt in
my mind that it's influenced by dozens of fantastic dark-colored themes, but I don't
have any particular references to call out.

Give it a try and see how to you like it. If it's useful for you please pass on a kind
word about it to your friends and teammates!

Check out this example of how this color theme makes code look:

# PHPStorm Support

Languages the color theme supports are admittedly Ken-centric including these:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* SCSS/SASS
* SQL
* PHP
* Regex
* Twig
* Xpath
* Smarty

Other languages are skipped simply because I don't reach for them often enough.

I've recently bought RubyMine and have brought over my color theme for PHPStorm into this
hot new IDE adding its languages.

## Supported Languages
* Ruby
* ERB
* HAML
* YAML
* (all the others above...)

# Favorite Fonts
This programmer font is highly recommended as I've used it daily for years and I know
I'm more productive because it exists:

[Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font)

Out of nowhere I've suddenly switched to this font as Adobe dropped it on the world just
a few weeks ago and I think it's fantastic:

[Adobe Source Code Pro Mono](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html)
